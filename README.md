# kata-machine

This repo is solution of [ThePrimeagen/kata-machine](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/kata-machine).

This project is clone of [ThePrimeagen/kata-machine](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/kata-machine) from the free DSA course available on [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/) as the _The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need_ which he teaches.

I have refactored it for my convenient, using `bun.js` for faster testing instead of `jest`. I have also added few additional tests for some algorithm and there will be some notes at the end of each file.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run test
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.3. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
